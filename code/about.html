          <p class="introduction">
            Hi, I’m Audrey Si, an aspiring Graphic Designer with a passion for creating visually compelling designs. I
            have a strong foundation in design principles, including typography, branding, and digital illustration, and
            I am proficient in using design tools like Adobe Creative Suite to bring my ideas to life.<br /><br />Throughout
            my journey as a designer, I have worked on several personal and academic projects, including logo designs,
            website mockups, and branding packages. These projects have not only strengthened my design skills but also
            deepened my understanding of user experience and visual communication.<br /><br />I’m eager to continue
            learning and growing in a collaborative environment where I can apply my creative skills and passion for
            design. I’m excited to take on new challenges and contribute fresh ideas. Feel free to explore my portfolio
            and reach out if you'd like to connect!
